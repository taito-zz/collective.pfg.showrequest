Introduction
============
Shows field labels and values on the next form generated by PloneFormGen.

Currently tested with
---------------------

* Plone-3.3.5

* Plone-4.1b2

* Products.PloneFormGen-1.6.0

Sometimes, you might need to chain forms to create wizard like forms where 
you want to see field input results from the previous form.
This package serves for this need by simply registering viewlet to plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IAboveContentBody interface.

How To
------
Once you have quickinstalled collective.pfg.showrequest, 
go to the Form Folder where you want to show the field results.
Check that you have thanks page in the Form Folder folder since this package uses
its method ``displayInputs`` to show the inputs results.
You do not need to check the thanks page in the Edit form of the Form Folder.

There is **Show Request** button under Actions, so click it.
You will see previous form results above the content body now like it is
on thanks page.

* All the field labels and values will be shown.
